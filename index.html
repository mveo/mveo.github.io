				<h4>Aims and Scope</h4>
				<p>
					Earth Observation (EO) is a rapidly growing research field that brings together computer vision, machine learning, and signal/image processing to provide valuable information about processes occurring at the Earth's surface. EO utilizes data from airborne and spaceborne sensors to capture detailed information on materials and biophysical properties across a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum, with varying spatial, temporal, and spectral resolutions. This multidimensional data necessitates the application of multiple pattern recognition tasks for analysis. Additionally, EO has a wide range of applications, including online mapping services, large-scale surveillance, urban modelling, navigation systems, natural hazard forecast and response, climate change monitoring, virtual habitat modelling, and more. This interdisciplinary field offers immense potential for advancing our understanding of Earth's dynamics and addressing complex societal and environmental challenges.
				</p>
				<p>
					The primary goal of this workshop is to foster collaboration and idea exchange between the Computer Vision and Remote Sensing communities, both nationally and internationally. We aim to bring together researchers and experts from both fields to promote interdisciplinary research, encourage innovative computer vision approaches for automated interpretation of Earth observation data, and enhance knowledge within the vision community for this rapidly evolving and highly impactful area of research.  The implications of this research are far-reaching, affecting human society, economy, industry, and the environment.
				</p>
				<p>
					Precisely, a non-exhaustive list of topics of interest includes the following:   
				</p>
				<ul class="general">
					<li class="general">
						Methods: Data-centric machine learning; remote sensing data + language processing (such as Large Language Models) models; open-set, open-world, and open long-tailed recognition; multi-resolution, multi-temporal, multi-sensor, multi-modal approaches; generative models (GANs, stable diffusion, etc); self-, weakly, semi-, and unsupervised approaches; human-in-the-loop and active learning; etc.
					</li>
					<li class="general">
						Tasks: Classification; object detection; segmentation (universal, semantic, panoptic, and/or instance); data augmentation and improvement; deep fake; domain adaptation and concept drift; super-resolution; explainability and interpretability; multi and hyperspectral, optical and radar image processing; and so on.
					</li>
					<li class="general">
						Applications: Disaster relief; urban planning; sustainable and intelligent agriculture; coast, sea, and marine monitoring; water conservation; circular economy; climate change; sustainable development goals; geoscience; phenological studies; and so on.
					</li>
