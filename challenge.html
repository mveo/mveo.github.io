				<h4>Data-Centric Land Cover Classification Challenge</h4>
				<p>
					Curating, labeling, and working with large data sets requires a significant investment of energy, time, and money. Focusing on a core set of the most valuable samples, tailored to the task at hand, can effectively reduce these costs. Such data-centric approaches that prioritize value and quality over quantity have the potential to achieve this goal. This relatively recent trend in the field of machine learning shifts the focus from improving machine learning models, also known as model-centric machine learning, to optimize the data used to train these models, including how this data is presented during the learning process.
				</p>
				<p>
					The data-centric land cover classification challenge, as part of the Workshop on Machine Vision for Earth Observation and Environment Monitoring and the British Machine Vision Conference (BMVC) 2023, aims at novel data-centric approaches towards selecting a core set of training samples. The challenge is a semantic segmentation task using the <a href="https://www.grss-ieee.org/community/technical-committees/2022-ieee-grss-data-fusion-contest/" target="_blank">Data Fusion Contest 2022 dataset</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Participants of this challenge are asked to develop a data selection and ranking strategy that provides a core set of training samples from a candidate pool with a ranking based on the samplesâ€™ value for training a pre-defined classifier. Success is measured by the mean average accuracy (mAP) on an undisclosed test dataset, where the classifier is trained with training datasets of different sizes based on the provided ranking. The goal of the participants is to maximize the area under curve obtained from the resulting mAPs.
